# MovieRecommendation

**Project Objective:**

In this group project, we developed a Movie Recommendation System using Python and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes movie datasets and suggests similar movies based on user preferences.
Key Steps in Development:

Importing Dependencies â€“ Utilized libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.
Data Collection & Preprocessing â€“ Loaded the movie dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, cleaned the data, and handled missing values.
Feature Extraction â€“ Implemented TF-IDF Vectorization to convert movie descriptions into numerical data for similarity comparison.
Similarity Measurement â€“ Used Cosine Similarity to find movies with the closest content match.
Recommendation System â€“ Employed difflib.get_close_matches to find the most relevant movie suggestions based on user input.

This project demonstrates proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and recommendation algorithms, which are essential skills for data science applications. ðŸš€
